68e5bbd4e51625a63fda4e3c,08 Oct 2025 09:18:12 AM,Success,ProcureLogic,Procurement,4,The hands-on approach to problem-solving was invaluable. Being able to directly engage with real procurement challenges and test potential AI solutions gave our team practical insights that theoretical training couldn't provide. The collaborative environment also fostered creative thinking and allowed us to learn from other teams' approaches.,"Our primary challenges were threefold: First, as newcomers to AI implementation, we needed more foundational training and exposure to build confidence with the technology. Second, data classification posed significant constraints since procurement data often exceeds restricted classification levels, limiting our ability to fully test solutions. Finally, the sprint timeline felt compressed given the complexity of both learning new AI concepts and developing a viable solution.","I'd recommend three key improvements: Provide more comprehensive AI training upfront to build foundational knowledge before diving into solution development. Extend the timeline slightly to allow for deeper exploration and iteration. Most importantly, establish clearer problem statements from the outset to help teams focus their efforts more effectively from day one",My immediate team,"Our sprint has sparked broader interest within our team and division in AI applications for procurement. The next phase involves testing our solution with real procurement data (within appropriate classification boundaries) to validate its effectiveness. We envision expanding this into a comprehensive AI-assisted procurement platform that could streamline processes across multiple government agencies, ultimately improving efficiency and decision-making in public sector procurement.","Yes, definitely","First, we'll deepen our team's AI literacy through targeted training programmes to build internal capability. Second, we'll conduct pilot testing with appropriately classified procurement data to refine our solution's accuracy and usability. Third, we'll engage with stakeholders across procurement teams to understand broader use cases and requirements for scaling the solution effectively.",6+ months,Technical mentorship;User testing support;Partnership connections;Access to data or tools,"Data classification remains our most significant barrier, as procurement data sensitivity limits our ability to fully leverage AI capabilities. Additionally, we'll need to address change management challenges as teams adapt to AI-assisted workflows, ensure compliance with government procurement regulations, and secure adequate resources for ongoing development and maintenance of the solution.",Maybe

68e5c84943683b1a28a9c421,08 Oct 2025 10:11:21 AM,Success,AI AHA,Digital Governance,3,Getting a peek into everyone's AI toolbox was amazing! Seeing what tools different teams were using and how they actually worked in practice was like getting a crash course in 'AI tools 101'.,"The biggest challenge was the sprint's tight timeline - it felt like we were sprinting through a marathon! We didn't have enough time for proper brainstorming and design thinking, which are crucial for developing well-thought-out solutions. The pace was so fast that we had to jump straight into execution mode without the deeper exploration phase we really needed.","Honestly, need to slow down and do this properly!",No one,"Next: proper brainstorming, user testing, and refining based on real feedback. The sprint was just the beginning!",Unsure,"Revisiting the initial assumptions, doing the design thinking work we rushed through, and then building something more thoughtful and thoroughly tested.",No timeline yet,Technical mentorship;User testing support,"Different teams have different needs, and that's probably our biggest scaling challenge.",No

Had to spend time to piece things tgt into a video, as compared to a physical presentation.",-,I'll definitely use it,"Implement it in phases, in SPD led meetings (e.g. SLM, ExCo) and then to other meeting platforms.","Maybe, depends on support/resources","I don't think i have the technical capabilities and time to refine it further, i think it works for the current use cases we have in mind.",Next quarter,Technical mentorship;Marketing/communications help,This is a recall bot that allow leaders to recall discussions and decisions across meetings based on meeting notes. So i think the biggest barriers is potentially low adoption (i.e. leaders/participants will likely use it when there is a specific need to and this need may not be frequent.,No
